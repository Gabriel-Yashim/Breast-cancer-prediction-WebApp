#### Demo Project

Breast cancer is a cancer that develops in the breast and spreads to other parts of the body. It can begin in either one or both of the breasts. The majority of breast cancers are carcinomas, which are tumors that begin in the epithelial cells that line the organs and tissues in the body. 
Adenocarcinoma, which begins in cells in the ducts (milk ducts) or the lobules, is the most common kind of carcinoma that forms in the breast (glands in the breast that make milk). When cells proliferate out of control, cancer develops. This system can predict between the two types of breast cancer (Benign = B, Malignant = M), all you need do is to supply the required information.
